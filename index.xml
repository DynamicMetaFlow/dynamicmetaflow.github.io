      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student at Northeastern University in the ALIGN program and pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. The ALIGN program consists of a series of bridge courses for graduate students who didn&amp;rsquo;t major in Computer Science in their undergraduate studies. Upon completion of the ALIGN program students begin taking graduate level classes in computer science. I&amp;rsquo;m currently taking CS5002 - Discrete and Data Structures.

      <description>My beginnings with technology starts in early childhood. During the weekends I visited my father and spent most of the time with my brother Robinson. Robinson, an electrical engineer from Dominican Republic, was my mentor and role-model. When I visited during the weekend I would find my brother taking apart and repairing different devices. I looked forward to spending time with him and I would ask questions about technology, such as &amp;ldquo;What is RAM?</description>
