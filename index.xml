      <description>My beginnings with technology starts in early childhood. During the weekends I visited my father and spent most of the time with my brother Robinson. Robinson, an electrical engineer from Dominican Republic, was my mentor and role-model. When I visited during the weekend I would find my brother taking apart and repairing different devices. I looked forward to spending time with him and I would ask questions about technology, such as &amp;ldquo;What is RAM?</description>
