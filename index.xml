      <description>Buttons and Smart Keys  Each button performs a specific action, linking to a file, executing a shell command.
 Explicit Buttons accessible from within a single document;
 Global Buttons accessible anywhere within a user&amp;rsquo;s network of documents;
 Implicit Buttons buttons created and managed by other programs or embedded within the structure of a document, accessible from within a single document. Hyperbole recognizes implicit buttons by contextual patterns given in their type specifications.</description>

      <description> Do you really need to collect that data? The less data you have the less vulnerable you and your customers are especially if database is compromised.
If you need to collect data, get value from the data results and then dump the data.

      <title>From fragmented notes to structured</title>

      <guid>https://alexsoto.dev/notes/posts/2019-12-25-1725-from-fragmented-notes-to-structured/</guid>
      <description>I create notes primarily in two ways.
 Using an org-capture template that captures the note as a subheading and gets refiled to inbox.org which would then get reviewed and may become a note on my system if it has value.
 I create a new note file skipping going to the inbox.
  Once a note is created and or converted to a file it exists in my Zettelkasten system.</description>

      <description>Typical Hyperbole applications include:
Personal Information Management Overlapping link paths provide a variety of views into an information space. A single key press activates buttons regardless of their types, making navigation easy.
A search facility locates buttons in context and permits quick selection.
Documentation Browsing Embedding cross-references in a favorite documentation format.
Addition of a point-and-click interface to existing documentation.
Linkage of code and design documents. Jumping to the definition of an identifier from its use within code or its reference within documentation.</description>

      <guid>https://alexsoto.dev/notes/posts/2019-12-25-1747-not-invented-here/</guid>
      <description>Not invented here (NIH) is a stance adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures that avoids using or buying already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins and costs, such as royalties. Research illustrates a strong bias against ideas from the outside.[1]
The reasons for not wanting to use the work of others are varied, but some can include a desire to support a local economy instead of paying royalties to a foreign license-holder, fear of patent infringement, lack of understanding of the foreign work, an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others, jealousy, belief perseverance, or forming part of a wider turf war.</description>

      <description> When notes are created they need to be reviewed, there is no easy way to review a note so I think rather than creating multiple files that may be empty I may initially create the note as a subtree, once it&amp;rsquo;s capture i determine if it&amp;rsquo;s worthwile expanding to when it then becomes a file.
The file that is created should also add the relationship with org-brain

      <description>The focus of this workshop is to show how wage theft occurs in our communities and to provide a social and digital context to understand this process through gamification and using workers&amp;rsquo; stories.
 In a floor or a table a large piece of paper will be the playcenter or the community of focus. Index cards will be labeled with different symbols that represent different forms of communication, places, and workers&amp;rsquo; stories.</description>

      <guid>https://alexsoto.dev/notes/posts/2019-12-25-1738-what-are-worker-centers/</guid>
      <description>Worker centers are community-based mediating institutions that provide support to and organize among communities of low-wage workers. Most centers focus their work geographically, operating in a particular city or neighborhood.
Worker centers in general have emerged in response to the decline of institutions that historically povided workers with a vehcicle for collective action. Immigrant worker centers have emerged as a consequence of the explosive growth of immigrant communities and the absence of infrastucture to support their needs.</description>

      <description>In 1946 - U.S Supreme Court Case - Anderson Vs. Mt.Clemens Pottery, enabled workers themselves to be the source of reliable evidence in wage cases.
Testimony must be reasonable for workers to testify about hours worked and pay received. Workers testimony is not sufficient due to faulty memory and inconsistencies.

      <description>The application consists of two parts:
Worker inputting current information  hours worked employer information working with workercenter alert messages  Retrieval of past information/history  phone logs location pictures videos  The first part focuses on the worker registering with a workercenter and maintaining and developing a relationship with them.
The second part focuses on building a log / timeline that can be used in court to to corroborate a workers story.</description>

Transform raw data to an exhibit that summarizes a person&amp;rsquo;s time on the job.
A worker&amp;rsquo;s schedule can vary and contributes to lack of information to hours worked.
A Cell phone is effectively a tracking device that you have decided to wear.</description>

      <description>Stigmergy is a form of self-organization, a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment between agents or actions. The main idea is that an action leaves a trace in the environment and it stimulates a next action to occur by a different agent that when occurring subsequently seems like a systematic activity.
One of the benefits of stigmergy is that it produces what appears to be intelligent structures without planning, control or communication between agents and promotes efficient collaboration between agents who lack memory, intelligence or awareness of each other.</description>

      <description> According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute, it&amp;rsquo;s estimated that low-wage workers in the U.S lost more than $50 billion to all forms of wage theft in 2016. The disproportionate share of wage theft victims are people of color, women, immigrants, young-people, workers from modest-income households non-unionized workers, and workers who do not have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.

      <description>One of the major sources of problem is: lack of information. If workers do not not know how many hours they worked in a given week, the worker cannot figure out whether they are being paid properly.
If a worker cannot testify in court to approximate hours in a given week, they cannot prove liability or damages. A worker&amp;rsquo;s schedule can vary and contributes to lack of information to hours worked.</description>
