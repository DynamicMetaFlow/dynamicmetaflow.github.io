            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My beginnings with technology starts in early childhood. During the weekends I visited my father and spent most of the time with my brother Robinson. Robinson, an electrical engineer from the Dominican Republic, was my mentor and role-model. When I visited during the weekend I would find my brother taking apart and repairing different devices. I looked forward to spending time with him and I would ask questions about technology, such as &ldquo;What is RAM?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What are the differences between AMD and Intel?&rdquo;. As a child, exposure to my brother&rsquo;s work was a valuable resource that expanded my knowledge, sparked my curiosity and interest in technology. As my skills developed I later assisted my brother in disassembling computers, running diagnostics, installing and upgrading software.</p>

<p>I then attended Middle School and a science professor was discarding a computer. I seized this opportunity and asked if I could have it, the professor donated the computer to me. I became the proud owner of a Pentium II 233 MHz Desktop Computer. This was my first computer. I carried the large desktop up the hill and walked several blocks to my house. I troubleshoot the different parts and identified the power supply wasn&rsquo;t working. I found an extra power supply from an abandoned computer and swapped the power supply.</p>

<p>Through this computer and my 56K modem, I had the world&rsquo;s knowledge at my fingertips. My mind was free to explore my interests unhindered from physical and economic barriers. Having a computer enabled me to excel in my studies compared to my peers who didn’t have access to one. Around the same time, I entered a summer program for Middle School students to take advance classes and prepare them for high school level work. One of the mentors in the program offered to buy a book from a Barnes and Nobles bookstore. I seized this opportunity and chose the &ldquo;C++ for Dummies&rdquo; book (at the time they seemed to be popular and provided comic relief). As the years progressed, I learned more about computers, increased my knowledge of technology and about the world.</p>

<p>From my experience, having access to technology or resources,  advanced my learning potential. By the time I entered high school, the skills I gained proved to be invaluable. I credit having access to a computer at a young age and having supportive mentors in shaping my path on being a self-learner. After graduating high school, I entered college to understand the problems that impact my communities and I majored in Political Science with minors in Philosophy and Latin American Studies.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here&hellip; a blog in 2019? <strong>Bueno, mejor que nada</strong>&hellip; This post is titled <strong>Hello World</strong>, it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate to someone or something else while being simultaneously born into a new digital world of our creation.</p>

<p>I want you to step into my world and I&rsquo;ll take you with me on this journey of pursuing my master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I see Computer Science as attaining a new ability to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.</p>

<p>This blog, this world that&rsquo;s being created will serve as a repository about what I&rsquo;m currently learning. I intend to share what I&rsquo;ve learned with others by creating content that&rsquo;s accessible to a wide audience. As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher and mentor, <strong>I seek to bridge technology and social justice.</strong> I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration… <strong>Pa&rsquo;lante!</strong></p>
