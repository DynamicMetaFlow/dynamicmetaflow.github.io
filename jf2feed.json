I was unaware of the level of rigor required for the program while also working full-time as a high school teacher compounded with life\u0026rsquo;s challenge\u0026rsquo;s and my own habits and emotions.\n.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; }  \nToday this comes to a stop.\n\n\nIn this website I will document my learning path and my process to hold myself accountable to reaching my goal of attaining my master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.\n In the Now section you can see my objectives for today, this week, month and year.    The Review section consists of a daily and weekly review, a micro-level look at my day including time stamps and a table with a summary of time spent on a given task.    The Courses section will contain courses that I am currently taking or have in the past with links to notes taken on the topics presented in the course.    The Notes section consists of my notes taken about a subject matter. The notes will be used to create lessons to be made accessible to a wider audience.  If you have any comments or suggestions please feel free to contact me.\n"},"name":"Accountability","published":"2019-01-04T00:00:00-05:00","summary":"While I was hospitalized for close to two years, the first trip that I made to society was to visit Northeastern University in one of their college tours for prospective students.
