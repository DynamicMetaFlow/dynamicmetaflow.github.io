Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here&#x2026; a blog in 2018? <b>Bueno, mejor que nada</b>&#x2026; This post is titled '<b>Hello World / Hola Mundo</b>', it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate to someone or something else while simultaneously being born into a new digital world of our creation.

I want you to step into my world and I'll take you with me on this journey of pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science. <b>To me I see Computer Science as attaining a new ability to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.</b> As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher and mentor &#x2013; <span class="underline"><b>I seek to bridge technology and social justice</b></span>. I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration&#x2026; <b>Pa'lante!</b></p>
