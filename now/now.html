Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics; staying up late at night pondering life and on the verge of an existential crisis, here we are&#x2026; A blog in 2018? Bueno, mejor que nada.. better than starting in 2019&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I want to take you with me on my journey of pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science. I expect this journey to be filled with twists and turns, moments of joy, tears, and frustration. 
</p>

<p>
Why Computer Science? Why now? To me I see Computer Science as gaining a new ability, to be able see the world through a computational lens, to have the opportunity to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.
</p>

<p>
The direction of this blog is to post about what I'm learning in the classes that I'm taking. While at the same time I intend to teach others what I'm learning about in an accessible way. 
</p>

<p>
In addition a location for different projects and or interests. 
</p>

<p>
A place to share different ideas about the intersection for technology and social justice.
