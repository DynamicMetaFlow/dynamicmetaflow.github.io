      <description>Stigmergy is a form of self-organization, a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment between agents or actions. The main idea is that an action leaves a trace in the environment and it stimulates a next action to occur by a different agent that when occurring subsequently seems like a systematic activity.
One of the benefits of stigmergy is that it produces what appears to be intelligent structures without planning, control or communication between agents and promotes efficient collaboration between agents who lack memory, intelligence or awareness of each other.</description>
