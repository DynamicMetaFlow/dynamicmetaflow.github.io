</header><blockquote>
<p>
This course is an accelerated introduction to computer science with the Python programming language. Along with the other courses in the Align program, it will prepare you to complete your Master's Degree in computer science.
</p>

<p>
We believe that computer science is for everyone. No matter what your background is, you can succeed in CS5001. Computer science is a creative, collaborative field &#x2013; it's not just programming. While programming is certainly an important craft and Python is an essential tool, we emphasize concepts and problem-solving over programming language. Learning computer science is like learning a new spoken language. There are rules of syntax and semantics, and sometimes a whole new mindset will apply. In this course, you'll learn how to think algorithmically, and how to solve problems elegantly.
