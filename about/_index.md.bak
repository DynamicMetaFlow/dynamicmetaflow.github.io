My name is Alexander Soto. I'm an activist, educator, technologist and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring issues in community-building, social justice, education and leveraging technology to address social problems. In the past I've worked as a labor rights organizer, a technology teacher at the [Margarita Mu√±iz Academy](<http://munizacademy.org>) and a mentor at [Resilient Coders](<http://www.resilientcoders.org>). I'm currently a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing my master's in Computer Science.
