Good morning mi amor! Yesterday we talked and decided to take a
break. I hope that today you have a <b>fantastic</b> day! I hope you are
doing your morning routine and you are experiencing joy and awe,
experiencing the wonder and joy of creating, making and taking one
more baby step to reaching our goals and being happier. I love you so
much like wow, and I can't wait to speak to you soon again. Bueno mi
amor, I have to go, a monkey beckons that I need to focus on my

Good morning my love, I hope you are doing well. I wonder how you
are doing today. I miss seeing you, holding you and kissing you. I
remember when it used to snow I would clean do my best to clear
your car with whatever was available, be it a broom, a rag or
anything. It initially sucked, being cold, almost falling in the
ice and at the same time the act of doing it together was
special. I hope that you were able to clean your car, that you are
safe and not driving too far(I know everyting is 10min away from
you and shit can still happen.) I'm in a good place and trying to
protect/guard my mind to the fire ants, they suck. Bueno amor, I
love you and I can't wait to talk to you soon. BeSoto's
