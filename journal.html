Good morning my love, I hope you are doing well. I wonder how you
are doing today. I miss seeing you, holding you and kissing you. I
remember when it used to snow I would clean do my best to clear
your car with whatever was available, be it a broom, a rag or
anything. It initially sucked, being cold, almost falling in the
ice and at the same time the act of doing it together was
special. I hope that you were able to clean your car, that you are
safe and not driving too far(I know everyting is 10min away from
you and shit can still happen.) I'm in a good place and trying to
protect/guard my mind to the fire ants, they suck. Bueno amor, I
love you and I can't wait to talk to you soon. BeSoto's

Good morning my love, Happy belated Valentine's day. I was meaning to
publish this journal note earlier, and I wasn't in the right state of
mind to, I'm doing better now! 
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your note/pictures you sent me, it was beautiful and touching. I miss you! I miss your laugh, the energy, the vibrations we
create when we are together, I miss your farts (&#x2026;, yes even your
farts ;P), our 10231232 hour long conversations about life when I ask
you, "babe are you sure," and then after asking 2 times on the third
time you change your mind.
</p>

<p>
This week for me has had it's up's and down's, I was able to focus on
my studies and finish all my homework assignments on time. I've been somewhat stressed about finances, and the appeal
process and I'm also trying to take steps to push past it. Right now
I'm in this critical stage of the semester with two weeks before the
midterm, and I'm trying to nourish, accept myself and grow.
</p>

<p>
I've been watching the Flash in my times of rest. I've always enjoy
superhero movies/shows, partly because it's incredible to see the special
effects and partly for them standing as being a challenge to reality,
and expand our notions of what's possible.  Another reason being is that it reminds me of the time when I thought I had superpowers, I partly still think I do have powers but more of a different kind that's internally created through hard work, and hard work and even more hard work.
</p>

<p>
Bueno amor, I love you, have a fantastic day today, and I can't wait to
talk to you tomorrow! BeSoto's!
