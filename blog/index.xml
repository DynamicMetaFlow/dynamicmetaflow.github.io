                <title>Hello World</title>
                <link>https://www.alexsoto.dev/blog/hello-world/</link>
                
                
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here… a blog in 2019? Bueno, mejor que nada… This post is titled ‘Hello World’, it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate with someone or something else while being simultaneously born into a new digital world of our creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to step into my world and I’ll take you with me on this
journey of becoming a software developer. The process of becoming a software developer is like attaining a new ability, to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog, this world that’s being created will serve as a repository about what I’m currently learning. I intend to share what I’ve learned with others by creating content that’s accessible to a wider audience. As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher, and mentor, I seek to bridge technology and social justice. I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration… Pa’lante!&lt;/p&gt;
