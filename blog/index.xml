                <title>Graduate School</title>
                <link>https://dynamicmetaflow.github.io/blog/graduate-school/</link>
                
                
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student at Northeastern University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.northeastern.edu/align/academic%5Fprogram/master-of-science-in-computer-science/&#34;&gt;ALIGN program&lt;/a&gt; pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. The ALIGN program consists of a series of bridge courses for graduate students who didn&amp;rsquo;t major in Computer Science in their undergraduate  studies. Upon completion of the ALIGN program students begin taking graduate level classes in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaining a master’s degree in computer science will link my community experience with technology and leverage this knowledge to contribute to the self-development and self-sufficiency of communities of color, as well as to enhance people’s capacities to solve problems. My long-term goal is to create a co-operative of social justice focused technologists, “Technology for Communities”, which specializes in civic technology to assist community organizations by assessing needs, analyzing data and creating solutions. A computer science degree combined with my collective experience as a community organizer will allow me to use technology collaboratively with organizations and individuals to address needs to strengthen communities and amplify our collective voice.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Game Over! Continue?</title>
                <link>https://dynamicmetaflow.github.io/blog/game-over-continue/</link>
                
                
                <description>&lt;p&gt;From about 2012 to 2014 I was hospitalized due to my mental health. This time period was one of the most painful and difficult times for me in my life: being away from friends, family and society. I was completely excluded from participating in society both physically and mentally, an outcast. I longed to walk in the city, to see my friends and family, to continue my education and to be involved in community. Upon my release in 2014 I had to restart my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reconnected with friends and started volunteering in different non-profits in the Boston area. My efforts in volunteering eventually lead me to the opportunity of being an AmeriCorps member for United Way. I along with others focused in providing services to residents in Lynn,MA. In my year of service I served at a high school: supporting students and teachers, creating an afterschool program, being a positive role model and providing support and services to the community. Around the same time period I found out about Resilient Coders. I decided to volunteer in their afterschool program that teaches youth from communities in the Boston area how to code. Fast forward to the present and I have worked for two years as a technology teacher at a highschool in Boston and was accepted into Northeastern&amp;rsquo;s Master&amp;rsquo;s program in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Latino, activist, mental health advocate and technologist, I have learned you must have a large systematic understanding of problems and issues that affect organizations, communities and individuals, in order to leverage technology as a tool for social change. I am deeply passionate about exploring the use of technology to address the lack of access and inequity in education, health and unemployment in communities of color.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Humble Beginnings</title>
                <link>https://dynamicmetaflow.github.io/blog/humble-beginnings/</link>
                
                
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My beginnings with technology starts in early childhood. During the weekends I visited my father and spent most of the time with my brother Robinson. Robinson, an electrical engineer from the Dominican Republic, was my mentor and role-model. When I visited during the weekend I would find my brother taking apart and repairing different devices. I looked forward to spending time with him and I would ask questions about technology, such as &amp;ldquo;What is RAM?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What are the differences between AMD and Intel?&amp;rdquo;. As a child, exposure to my brother&amp;rsquo;s work was a valuable resource that expanded my knowledge, sparked my curiosity and interest in technology. As my skills developed I later assisted my brother in disassembling computers, running diagnostics, installing and upgrading software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then attended Middle School and a science professor was discarding a computer. I seized this opportunity and asked if I could have it, the professor donated the computer to me. I became the proud owner of a Pentium II 233 MHz Desktop Computer. This was my first computer. I carried the large desktop up the hill and walked several blocks to my house. I troubleshooted the different parts and identified the power supply wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. I found an extra power supply from an abandoned computer and swapped the power supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this computer and my 56K modem, I had the world&amp;rsquo;s knowledge at my fingertips. My mind was free to explore my interests unhindered from physical and economic barriers. Having a computer enabled me to excel in my studies compared to my peers who didn’t have access to one. Around the same time, I entered a summer program for Middle School students to take advance classes and prepare them for high school level work. One of the mentors in the program offered to buy a book from a Barnes and Nobles bookstore. As the years progressed, I learned more about computers, increased my knowledge of technology and about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience, having access to technology or resources,  advanced my learning potential. By the time I entered high school, the skills I gained proved to be invaluable. I credit having access to a computer at a young age and having supportive mentors in shaping my path on being a self-learner. After graduating high school, I entered college to understand the problems that impact my communities and I majored in Political Science with minors in Philosophy and Latin American Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Hello World</title>
                <link>https://dynamicmetaflow.github.io/blog/hello-world/</link>
                
                
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here&amp;hellip; a blog in 2019? &lt;strong&gt;Bueno, mejor que nada&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip; This post is titled &lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt;, it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate to someone or something else while being simultaneously born into a new digital world of our creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to step into my world and I&amp;rsquo;ll take you with me on this journey of pursuing my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I see Computer Science as attaining a new ability to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog, this world that&amp;rsquo;s being created will serve as a repository about what I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning. I intend to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with others by creating content that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to a wider audience. As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher and mentor, &lt;strong&gt;I seek to bridge technology and social justice.&lt;/strong&gt; I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration… &lt;strong&gt;Pa&amp;rsquo;lante!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
