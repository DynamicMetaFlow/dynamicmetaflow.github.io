            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I was hospitalized for close to two years, the first trip that I made to society was to visit Northeastern University in one of their college tours for prospective students. At the time when I was hospitalized, I was learning Python, and I didn&rsquo;t have reliable access to a computer. In times I didn&rsquo;t have access to a computer, I printed pages from a PDF and took notes on scratch paper that nurses gave me.</p>

<p>I feel immense pride to say years later I was accepted to Northeastern University. I&rsquo;m honored to be the first in my family to be admitted to graduate school. I&rsquo;m a neurodivergent, person of color, Latino pursuing my master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. With all that being said I have not done well in my graduate classes. I was unaware of the level of rigor required for the program while also working full-time as a high school teacher compounded with life&rsquo;s challenge&rsquo;s and my own habits, emotions and insecurities.</p>

<p>In this website, I will document my learning path and my process to hold myself accountable for reaching my goal of attaining my master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a graduate student at Northeastern University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/align/academic%5Fprogram/master-of-science-in-computer-science/">ALIGN program</a> pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. The ALIGN program consists of a series of bridge courses for graduate students who didn&rsquo;t major in Computer Science in their undergraduate studies. Upon completion of the ALIGN program, students begin taking graduate-level classes in computer science.</p>

<p>My interest in attaining a master’s degree in computer science is to link my community experience with technology and leverage this knowledge to contribute to the self-development and self-sufficiency of communities of color, as well as to enhance people’s capacities to solve problems. My long-term goal is to create a workers cooperative of social justice focused technologists, “Technology for Communities,” which specializes in civic technology to assist community organizations by assessing needs, analyzing data and creating solutions. A computer science degree combined with my collective experience as a community organizer will allow me to use technology collaboratively with organizations and individuals to address needs to strengthen communities and amplify our collective voice.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From about 2012 to 2014 I was hospitalized due to my mental health. This period was one of the most painful and challenging times for me in my life: being away from friends, family, and society. I was completely excluded from participating in society both physically and mentally, an outcast. I longed to walk in the city, to see my friends and family, to continue my education and to be involved in a community. Upon my release in 2014, I had to restart my life.</p>

<p>I reconnected with friends and started volunteering in different non-profits in the Boston area. My efforts in volunteering eventually lead me to the opportunity of being an AmeriCorps member for United Way. I along with others focused on providing services to residents in Lynn, MA. In my year of service, I served at a high school: supporting students and teachers, creating an afterschool program, being a positive role model and providing support and services to the community. Around the same period, I found out about Resilient Coders. I decided to volunteer in their afterschool program that teaches youth from communities in the Boston area how to code. Fast forward to the present, and I have worked for two years as a technology teacher at a high school in Boston and was accepted into Northeastern&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s program in computer science.</p>

<p>As a Latino, activist, mental health advocate and technologist, I have learned you must have a systematic understanding of problems and issues that affect organizations, communities, and individuals, to leverage technology as a tool for social change. I am deeply passionate about exploring the use of technology to address the lack of access and inequity in education, health, and unemployment in communities of color.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My beginnings with technology start in early childhood. During the weekends I visited my father and spent most of the time with my brother Robinson. Robinson, an electrical engineer from the Dominican Republic, was my mentor and role-model. When I visited during the weekend, I would find my brother taking apart and repairing different devices. I looked forward to spending time with him, and I would ask questions about technology, such as &ldquo;What is RAM?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What are the differences between AMD and Intel?&rdquo;. As a child, exposure to my brother&rsquo;s work was a valuable resource that expanded my knowledge, sparked my curiosity and interest in technology. As my skills developed, I later assisted my brother in disassembling computers, running diagnostics, installing and upgrading software.</p>

<p>I then attended Middle School, and a science professor was discarding a computer. I seized this opportunity and asked if I could have it, the professor donated the desktop to me. This was my first computer. I carried the large desktop up a hill and walked several blocks to my house. I troubleshot the desktop and identified the power supply wasn&rsquo;t working. I swapped the power supply from an abandoned computer, and voila, I became the proud owner of a Pentium II 233 MHz Desktop Computer.</p>

<p>Through this computer and my 56K modem, I had the world&rsquo;s knowledge at my fingertips. My mind was free to explore my interests unhindered from physical and economic barriers. Having a computer enabled me to excel in my studies compared to my peers who didn’t have access to one. Around the same time, I entered a summer program for Middle School students to take advanced classes and prepare them for high school level work. One of the mentors in the program offered to buy a book from a Barnes and Nobles bookstore. As the years progressed, I learned more about computers, increased my knowledge of technology and about the world.</p>

<p>From my experience, having access to technology or resources,  advanced my learning potential. By the time I entered high school, the skills I had gained proved to be invaluable. I credit having access to a computer at a young age and having supportive mentors in shaping my path on being a self-learner. After graduating high school, I entered college to understand the problems that impact my communities, and I majored in Political Science with minors in Philosophy and Latin American Studies.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here… a blog in 2019? <em><span class="underline">Bueno, mejor que nada…</span></em> This post is titled <span class="underline"><em>&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;</em>,</span> it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate with someone or something else while being simultaneously born into a new digital world of our creation.</p>

<p>I want you to step into my world and I’ll take you with me on this journey of pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Science. I see Computer Science as attaining a new ability to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share knowledge with others.</p>

<p>This blog, this world that’s being created will serve as a repository about what I’m currently learning. I intend to share what I’ve learned with others by creating content that’s accessible to a wider audience. As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher, and mentor, <strong>I seek to bridge technology and social justice.</strong> I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration… <strong>Pa’lante!</strong></p>
