            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years after many conversations with friends about niche topics, staying up late at night pondering life on the verge of an existential crisis, we have arrived here&hellip; a blog in 2018? <strong>Bueno, mejor que nada</strong>&hellip; This post is titled &lsquo;<strong>Hello World</strong>&rsquo;, it symbolizes the first step we take to attempt to communicate to someone or something else while simultaneously being born into a new digital world of our creation.</p>

<p>I want you to step into my world and I&rsquo;ll take you with me on this journey of pursuing my master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>To me, I see Computer Science as attaining a new ability to be able to see the world through a computational lens, the opportunity to creatively solve problems and to contribute, create and share  knowledge with others. As someone who in the past has been deeply involved with community-building as a former community organizer, teacher and mentor &ndash; <span class="underline"><strong>I seek to bridge technology and social justice</strong></span>. I expect this journey to be filled with moments of joy, tears, and frustration&hellip; <strong>Pa&rsquo;lante!</strong></p>
