                <p>I&rsquo;m currently a graduate student at Northeastern University and I&rsquo;m part of the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/align/academic_program/master-of-science-in-computer-science/">ALIGN program</a> pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. The ALIGN program are a series of bridge courses for graduate students that didn&rsquo;t major in Computer Science in their undergraduate studies. Upon completion of the ALIGN program students begin taking graduate level classes in computer science. I&rsquo;m currently taking my first ALIGN course, CS5001 or &ldquo;fundies&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s called at Northeastern University. From the Northeastern University course description catalog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and programming principles. Discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing. Presents several models of computing, beginning with functional program design. The latter part of the course consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). Offers students an opportunity to practice pair programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The course primarily uses the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">How To Design Programs</a> textbook and a
series of &ldquo;teaching languages&rdquo; that introduce additional core syntax
and concepts of programming using the Racket language. The class meets
twice a week, one day for lecture and another for recitation. We have
gone over and gained an understanding of several concepts and ideas
such as: the &ldquo;Design Recipe&rdquo;, structs, lists, binary trees, local,
lambda, abstractions and general recursion. In a future post, I will go over what I learned from this course.</p>
